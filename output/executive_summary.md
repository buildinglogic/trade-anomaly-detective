Executive Summary:

As part of our ongoing trade compliance efforts, we have conducted an analysis of 250 shipments, identifying 20 anomalies that pose a significant risk to our organization. Our review has uncovered critical issues that require immediate attention to mitigate potential penalties and financial losses. The findings of this analysis are summarized below, highlighting key areas of concern and recommended actions to ensure compliance and minimize risk.

The top 3 most urgent issues that require immediate attention are: 
1. SHP-2025-0089, where an incorrect HS code was used, potentially attracting a penalty of approximately ₹4,465,500 (USD 53,550 * ₹83), 
2. SHP-2025-0034, which involves a FOB mismatch resulting in a potential loss of ₹7,44,000 (USD 9,000 * ₹83), and 
3. SHP-2025-0067, where the unit price of Cotton T-shirts is significantly lower than the mean price, potentially indicating an error in pricing or classification.

Our analysis has identified trends indicating discrepancies in pricing, compliance, and payment categories, as well as issues related to route logistics. These trends suggest a need for enhanced monitoring and verification of shipment data to prevent similar anomalies in the future.

The total potential penalty risk associated with these anomalies is approximately ₹4,465,500. To mitigate this risk, we recommend taking the following immediate actions:
* Conduct a thorough review of HS codes used in recent shipments to ensure accuracy and compliance
* Verify FOB values for all shipments to prevent mismatches and potential losses
* Implement additional checks on unit prices for high-risk products, such as Cotton T-shirts, to prevent errors in pricing or classification
* Develop a corrective action plan to address the root causes of these anomalies and prevent recurrence in the future.

By addressing these urgent issues and implementing corrective measures, we can minimize potential penalties, reduce financial losses, and ensure compliance with trade regulations.
